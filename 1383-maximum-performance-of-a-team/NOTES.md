1. sorting in terms of Max efficiency and then from max ro least effciency we cal the total engineers required until **K members in the team** not achieved.
2. ***we use heap to pop out the mini value of the speed of eng upto k eng***  and add in their **Max Profecincy** as *speed  -= heappop( speed )*
3. and then checking the last value in the Max Proficiency to the present value to find the max of all previous value
by using the formula **(Least efficiency x Sum of eng)**
